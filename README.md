## 👩‍💻 About Me ✨ 

🎓 I have been working on understanding how the collective behavior of ordering in liquid crystal molecules modifies their properties and interactions.  
My research has focused on modeling systems using **coarse-grained models** to analyze colloidal liquid crystals, which can be described as **soft or hard rods**. Additionally, I have simulated **molecular-scale models**, representing atomic interactions within liquid crystal molecules. You can read more about it here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01491

Recently, I have been transitioning into **Machine Learning & Data Science**, working on projects related to **predictive modeling and deep learning**.  
🔹 Check out my latest project below! ⬇️

## Throughout my simulations, I have tackled challenges such as:  
- Developing **statistical and thermodynamic models** to describe molecular behavior.  
- Selecting appropriate **interaction potentials** and implementing them in simulations.  
- **Processing and analyzing large-scale datasets**, applying **data cleaning and feature engineering**.  
- Using **Machine Learning techniques like DBSCAN** to perform clustering analysis and identify patterns in molecular behavior.

## 🚀 Skills & Technologies  
🔹 **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciKit-Learn, TensorFlow), SQL, Linux, Git  
🔹 **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
🔹 **Machine Learning:** Supervised & Unsupervised Learning, Deep Learning, Clustering  

This experience has led me to develop a strong interest in **Data Science and Machine Learning**, as these fields provide powerful tools that can be adapted not only to molecular simulations but also to various other industries.  

I am currently transitioning into a more **industry-oriented role**, where I aim to apply my skills in **data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning** to solve real-world problems.  
I am also working on projects related to **Deep Learning and Neural Networks**, exploring how these technologies can be leveraged for predictive modeling and optimization.
